# Securing an Ocelot Gateway with Azure Active Directory

This repo is about implementing security for an Ocelot gateway using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

The code integrates Azure AD into an Ocelot gateway, providing robust authentication and authorization for APIs in a microservices architecture. By leveraging Ocelot, a .NET library for creating API gateways, the implementation ensures secure communication between microservices.

The repository includes examples of how to configure Ocelot to work with Azure AD, protect APIs with OAuth2.0, and manage access tokens. This setup is ideal for securing production environments where protecting API endpoints is critical.
